# E05b-Physics

Hello, this is Hua Zhao. For the assignment I have changed the main1 and main2 and main3. The first file is for balls drop on the bottom of the screen. The second file is balls drop to the ground and bounce back. And the last file is to have 5 sprites with collisions. To make the achivement, I learned the gravity and velocity. m1v1=m2v2 will be the function apply to the main3.py. Having main1 and 2 working, we need the add the acceleration on the objects.
Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

In *main1.py*, you will need to apply gravity to the balls on the screen. To do so, you will need to find an appropriate gravity constant and assign GRAVITY to that number (line 17). Because of the way the Y axis works in Python Arcade, GRAVITY will need to be a negative number for the balls to fall.

You will then need to accelerate the balls according to the GRAVITY constant. You can call b.accelerate(x,y) on line 67. In the case of applying gravity, x will be 0 and y will be GRAVITY.

*main2.py*, is a little more complicated. You will need to apply all the lessons you learned in main1.py, but now we want the balls to bounce off the walls. First apply the GRAVITY constant from main1.py and accelerate the balls. Then, lines 39, 45, 51, and 57 will ask you to bounce (reverse the velocity) of the ball when it hits a wall. Think about what we discussed in class. I am applying some friction so they don't bounce forever.

*main3.py* implements the worst, most-naive version of collision physics using the built-in sprite collision detection. Assuming all the animal heads have the same mass, adjust lines 53â€“60 to make the collisions more realistic.
